* Analyzing Patient Responses to Formulary Changes (with Josh Feng and Luca Maini)
<!---
** Placing a product on a favorable drug tier is very valuable for drug manufacturers, as it leads to higher demand for their product. If a drug manufacturer is able to move to a better tier, from one year to another, all else equal, they should expect consumers to shift to their product. However, due to history dependence, patients may find a switch costly, which may limit the upside of a drug manufacturer going for a better tier. Using private claims data, we estimate demand in the insulin market for patients that are on plans that have an insulin product shift tiers between years. Preliminary results suggest that patients do predominantly shift towards the cheaper alternative, even in the presence of history dependence.

* How Costly are Pharmaceutical Line Extensions?
    * Launching a pharamceutical line extension allows a firm to continue to earn profits, for up to 3 years after the original formulation expires, by steering patients from the original formulation to the line extension. This steering is profitable, as this steered market share is shielded from generics for the original formulation, as generic substitution laws will not apply for prescriptions of the line extension. Despite a profitable advantage for launching a line extension, many firms don't launch one. One reason is that line extensions are incremental improvements and do require some level of research and development, although unlikely as costly as a novel drug. Using revenue data, I estimate a cost distribution for line extensions, by forecasting foregone profits from not launching and additional profits earned if a line extension was never launched. I find that line extensions cost on average between 430 and 570 million and using these estimates conduct back of the envelope estiamtes of removing exclusivity altogether.
* Missing out on the Hype?
    * Large sneaker firms like Nike and Adidas frequently release limited quantities of coveted "Hypebeast" shoes, which are extremely popular. These shoes sell out instantly online and are often listed on shoe auction sites for substantially higher prices. Fascinatingly, these shoes clear the auctions at those inflated prices. This paper considers a model that offers an explanation as to why firms don't either increase their quantity of the product or the price to capitalize on the high demand for the product.
